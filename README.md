Big thanks and hugs to XenoMars for buying the game for me so I can keep modding it! üòäüíñ

## Download and instructions

[Download üíñ](../../releases/latest)

Extract straight into the game folder, then run the game. First time running the game after installing the mod can take a few minutes. Afterwards it should be fast as usual.

### Steam Deck users

After copying the mod to your game folder you will need to add the following launch option to the game's properties on Steam:
```
WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp.dll=n,b" %command%
```
(Thanks to Kou-kun for figuring that out~)

### For ultrawide/custom resolutions

Follow [this guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2699973520) to set your preferred resolution. If the black bars fix doesn't work, user DT reported disabling the Steam overlay for the game helped.

### To change hotkeys

First run the latest version of the mod at least once so it generates a config file. Then, simply open the file BepInEx\config\JKSFix.cfg in notepad, and change the keybinds there.

### Advanced graphics settings

Like hotkeys, these can only be changed manually via config file, in the Rendering section.

Any value set to the default of -1 is ignored by the mod (so the game's default is applied instead).

Values are not validated or sanitized so make sure you know the values you're setting are supported! (Watch out, some of them correspond to Unity enums, too!)

There's also a hotkey to reload all Rendering settings during runtime.

## Quick troubleshooting and disclaimer

If the mod doesn't work, make sure to install VC++ redistributable if you haven't already! [Find it here.](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

I don't know if this is compatible with other mods, and I haven't played the game a lot so there could be bugs or issues, use at your own risk!

## Building the DLL (for developers!)

1. Install Samurai Maiden on your computer

2. Add BepInEx for Unity IL2CPP 6.0.0 to your Samurai Maiden installation, then run it at least once afterwards

   * If you already ran a previous version of JKSFix on your Samurai Maiden installation, you can skip this step!

   * [Here is a guide](https://docs.bepinex.dev/master/articles/user_guide/installation/unity_il2cpp.html) on the installation.
  
   * Development was done with `BepInEx-Unity.IL2CPP-win-x64-6.0.0-be.664+0b23557`, but newer versions will probably work too.

3. Clone this repo, and create a file named `User.proj` in the `BepInEx` folder, with the following content:

    ```xml
    <Project>
      <PropertyGroup>
        <GameDir>C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\SAMURAI MAIDEN\</GameDir>
      </PropertyGroup>
    </Project>
    ```

    But replace the directory with the one where *your* copy of Samurai Maiden is installed.

4. Open the project in Visual Studio and build away!
